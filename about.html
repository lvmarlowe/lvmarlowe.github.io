            <h2>Madame Fluffycorn</h2>
            <br />
            <h3 class="about__title">the psychic</h3>
            <br />
            <p>
              Madame Fluffycorn is a psychic extraordinaire who stumbled upon
              her gift during a particularly intense game of hide-and-seek.
              While hiding in a broom closet, she suddenly became aware of the
              exact location of all the other players, even though they were
              scattered throughout the house. From that moment on, she knew she
              had a special talent for sensing the unseen.<br /><br />
              When she's not practicing her mystical craft, Madame Fluffycorn
              loves to indulge in her hobbies. She enjoys knitting cozy sweaters
              for her cats, playing the ukulele, and collecting unicorn
              figurines. Her love of unicorns is unbridled, and she channels
              their magic through her colorful wardrobe and her mystical
              readings. Her clients often leave her sessions feeling uplifted
              and inspired to follow their passions, just like Madame
              Fluffycorn's love for all things magical.

            <h2>MJ Dreyfuss</h2>
            <br />
            <h3 class="about__title">the artist</h3>
            <br />
            <p>
              MJ Dreyfuss is a professional artist with a penchant for the
              peculiar and a love for the ludicrous. She began her artistic
              journey in high school where she was often found squatting between
              vending machines, drawing everything from unicorns to zombies.<br /><br />
              It was during one of these drawing sessions that she was
              discovered by Madame Fluffycorn, who was trying to dislodge a bag
              of hot Cheetos from the vending machine. Madame Fluffycorn was
              immediately captivated by MJ's imaginative doodles. The two
              quickly bonded over their shared love of the bizarre and the
              supernatural, and the rest is Oddstrology.

            <h2>Duncan</h2>
            <br />
            <h3 class="about__title">the office dog</h3>
            <br />
            <p>
              Duncan is the official office dog of Oddstrology and the loyal
              companion of Madame Fluffycorn. He may not know the difference
              between astrology and astronaut, but he makes up for it with his
              adorably derpy smile and a heart of gold.<br /><br />
              Duncan is always ready to lend a paw, whether it's holding down
              important papers or keeping Madame Fluffycorn's feet warm during
              late-night stargazing sessions. His superpower is his ability to
              drool on command, which he uses to remind everyone to stay
              hydrated. With his floppy ears and wiggly tail, Duncan is a
              constant source of joy and laughter for the Oddstrology team. When
              he's not snoozing in his dog bed, he can be found playing fetch or
              practicing his downward dog pose during office yoga sessions.
